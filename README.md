## Catchy title (2-3 words)

Smarter than the average bear.

## Personal Headline

Engineering professional with 20+ years of proven excellence in multiple roles.
Throughout my career I have excelled in roles high and low, from managing multi-million dollar projects, to programming complex mechanical systems, and to leading a team of engineers and project managers.
I attribute this to working hard as well as being slightly smarter than the average bear.
Whatever the need is: management, programming, technical, or interpersonal - I have the experience and track record to meet it.

## Professional Pitch

I spent the last 18 years in the building automation industry, doing everything from managing big projects, to programming complex mechanical systems, to being a people manager as the Training and Engineering Manager.  After 18 years, although I loved my job, there was nothing left for me to accomplish in the world of controls so I wanted to find the next challenge in life.  One thing I really enjoyed is programming.  But the programming I did was weird, proprietary code, and so I wanted to learn a more mainstream language.  I took a programming bootcamp and learned JavaScript and Python, and now I'm ready for the next challenge in life.

## What excites me about tech

Taking some from the idea stange and making it happen in real life.
